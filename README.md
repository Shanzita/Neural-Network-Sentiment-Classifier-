This project implements a neural sentiment classifier that predicts whether Amazon book reviews are positive or negative by transforming raw text into numerical features using TF-IDF and classifying them with a feed-forward neural network built in Keras. The pipeline begins with loading and cleaning the dataset, extracting the Review column as text features and Positive Review as binary labels, and splitting the data into training and test sets for reproducibility. Reviews are converted into a sparse numerical representation with TfidfVectorizer, which captures word importance across the corpus, resulting in a vocabulary of nearly 18,500 terms. The model architecture is a Keras Sequential network with three dense layers (64, 32, 16 neurons, each using ReLU activation) followed by a final sigmoid output for binary classification, compiled with SGD (learning rate 0.1), binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. Training is conducted over 55 epochs with an 80/20 validation split, producing both loss and accuracy plots to analyze convergence, while evaluation on the test set demonstrates a performance of about 81.8% accuracy, consistent with validation results though with some overfitting observed as training accuracy climbs toward 100% while validation accuracy stabilizes near 80%. The project structure includes the dataset (bookReviews.csv), the notebook with full implementation, and optionally a script for CLI execution with configurable arguments such as epochs, validation split, learning rate, and threshold. Results show that the classifier generalizes reasonably well, but improvements can be achieved by tuning hyperparameters, reducing epochs, adding dropout layers, adjusting the TF-IDF vectorizer settings, or switching to optimizers like Adam. Overall, this project demonstrates a complete end-to-end NLP workflow from data preprocessing to vectorization, model building, training, and evaluation, making it a clear and reproducible example of applying machine learning to sentiment analysis.
